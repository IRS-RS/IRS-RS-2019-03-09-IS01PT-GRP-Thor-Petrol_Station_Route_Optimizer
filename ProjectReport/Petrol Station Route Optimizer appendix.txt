Hi Sam,

I will summarize how the GA is run for the program :-

For example, the start point is A, end point is B and X,Y,Z are the intermediate points. The possible petrol staions identified for this user are P1,P2 and P3, so we have to optimise the route comprising A, B, X, Y and Z and include one of the pumps.

Step 1
We create a temporary point, T with distances 0 to A and B (this takes care of the issue that the solution start has to start with A and end with B)

Step 2
We run the GA 3 times, with the following sets
A, B, X, Y, Z, T, P1 (iteration 1)
A, B, X, Y, Z, T,  P2 (iteration 2)
A, B, X, Y, Z, T,  P3 (iteration 3)

For each iteration in this step, we keep track of the lengths of the top 3 shortest path options

Step 3
We choose the shortest path from Step 2, clean the list by removing T and return the answer.

So each time the GA is run, one petrol station is part of the list. 

Thanks

Rana
