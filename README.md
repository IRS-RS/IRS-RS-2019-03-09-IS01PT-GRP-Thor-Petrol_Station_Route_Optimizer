## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
How people live, work and spend their money has changed dramatically over the past decade, especially with the advent of today’s disruptive technology. The new and disruptive technologies have opened new ways to make and spend money – online, picking up a “gig” (freelance engagement) is as easy as making plans for dinner or finding a date. In other words, we are also leaving in an “Appgeneration”, where apps are changing the world, and we are part of the change.  The numerous apps are altering the way that people view and perform work. Often driven by algorithms that align supply with demand, these apps are also paving the road towards an economy in which services are supplied only when needed and reachable to a wider audience. 
The result is a system of flexible working that stands in stark contrast to the corporate world’s insistence on a five day, nine-to-five work week. Flexibility and autonomy are what draw many to the freelance lifestyle, but such freelancers have limited productivity and organizational tools unlike multinational companies. The demand for freelance couriers’ services is expected to grow year on year given the popularity of online shopping and e-commerce. In addition, one key weekly tasks that a freelance courier need to do is refueling of his/her vehicle. This task is also a common task to any driver.  
Our project team would like to build an app that helps freelance couriers to improve their productivity as well as locate a preferred petrol station (the petrol station with the best price offer based on choice of credit card) along one of their routes for any driver. The reason we are targeting the logistic industry, is because the need of low cost non urgent delivery services is on the rise, where items can be placed at designated drop off points and delivered to designated collections points for customers to pick up. These drop off points and collections points can be at retails malls or commercial premises. Transportation and manpower expenditure are key cost elements to these companies, and many of these companies leverage freelance couriers for the logistic services. In addition, the app should also benefit the man on the street to locate the optimize route from one destination to another including locating the preferred petrol station.
Using the techniques imparted to us in lectures, our group first set out to build a hybrid reasoning system that incorporates an expert system built using rules engine like Clips which helps in selecting the preferred petrol station together with genetic algorithm written in python to determine optimized routes to any of the app user. The app will display all these through visual maps as well as the suggested segments of the routes. 
Our team had an exciting time working on this project and hope to share our insights with everyone. There are truly are a wide array of individual factors to come to a final decision in the switch to a different pricing plan, and we only wish there was more time to work on the scope and scale of the project.
